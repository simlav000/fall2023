INTEGER OPERATORS
	we have the regular +, *, /, - mathematical operators for integers.
	there is no integer exponentiation operator
	
FLOATING POINT OPERATORS
	we must add a period for floating points, meaning +., *., /., -.
	we also have ** which does not require a point. It is used for exponentiation
STRING OPERATORS
	we can do "str1" ^ "str2" to concatenate strings

PIPE OPERATORS |> <|
	|> is known as the forward pipe and can be used to chain together functions. Take the following example which exponentiates integers by 
	converting the base and exponents to floats, and pipes the result back to an int
	
		let exp_int base exponent = float_of_int base ** float_of_int exponent |> int_of_float
			(* as we can see, we convert base and exponent to floats, exponentiate them, and pipe the result to the int_of_float number to return an int *)
